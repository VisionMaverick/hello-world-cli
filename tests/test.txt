Experience and Tooling
Summary

This document proposes the adoption of Backstage, an open-source platform for building developer portals, within our company. Backstage aims to streamline the developer experience by providing a centralized location for managing APIs, components, tools, and documentation. This RFC outlines the potential benefits of Backstage in the context of our current development landscape, addresses potential challenges, and proposes a plan for implementation.

Context

Our company, a major player in the fintech industry alongside Stripe and World Line, thrives on a robust development environment. However, as our codebase and development teams grow, managing tools, documentation, and API access can become increasingly complex. Developers often waste valuable time searching for resources or struggling with outdated documentation.

Problem Statement

The current developer experience faces several challenges:

Scattered Resources: Development resources are spread across various platforms and repositories, making it difficult for developers to find what they need quickly.
Inconsistent Documentation: Documentation may be outdated, siloed, or difficult to navigate, hindering developer productivity.
Fragmented Tooling: Developers rely on a patchwork of tools for different tasks, leading to inefficiencies and compatibility issues.
Features Provided by Backstage (Best suited for: Benefits & Context Sections)
