One
     Action:
        Develop an RFC/ADR to design and build a generic framework for monitoring any migration activity, with the first target being the ongoing migration. Complete this by Q3.
        Obtain access to work as a release manager by the end of this month.
        Request and gain access to be part of the duty team within the next two weeks.

     Note:
        After moving from the BDP to XYZ's main project, my initial focus was understanding the functionality of the product and XYZ's main code base, design, and frameworks. I took responsibility for table partitioning in reliability. Going forward, I will ensure I follow up on all discussed actions and increase my involvement in the release process and incident management.

     Action:
        Identify functional/technical gaps in R team product lines and create an RFC/ADR each quarter, presenting these in Architecture or tech review meetings.
        Develop detailed designs and basic frameworks, guiding engineers to deliver solutions for gaps identified in the previous quarter.
        Complete the backstage RFC presentation by 12th June and finalize the pending work by end of June, then guide team members on data solutions.
    Note:
        Since joining the R team, I have created documents for table partitioning, RFC and PAM products, and ADR for r-b authentication. I will now plan to present these documents to a broader audience.

    Action:
        Document questions and concerns in shared documents for greater visibility.
        Present these documented concerns and potential solutions in team meetings for more comprehensive feedback.
    Note:
        I have discussed requirements and gaps with the product manager, UX lead, and RP team members. I created and presented an RFC document to product and risk teams. Moving forward, I will include cross-team members for broader visibility.

Two
    Action:
        Escalate to higher management if cross-team projects are delayed due to other teams, ensuring prompt resolution.
        Set clear timelines and follow-ups to ensure project completion.
    Note:
        The database partitioning project took longer due to DBA and platform team dependencies. I highlighted this in our one-to-one discussions. I completed the r-b authentication project by the end of April despite the target being March-April.
    Action:
        Actively participate in technical conversations and provide feedback upfront, leveraging my better understanding of the product after working on three different projects in XYZ main.
    Note:
        I regularly discuss and debate requirements with the product manager and have organized meetings with the r team and product manager to clarify doubts. Going forward, I will include more cross-team members for comprehensive discussions.

    Action:
        Identify functional/technical gaps in R team product lines and create an RFC/ADR each quarter, presenting these in Architecture or tech review meetings.
        Develop detailed designs and frameworks, guiding engineers to deliver solutions for gaps identified in the previous quarter.
    Note:
        My initial conversation with the r team lead identified two major pain points: database partitioning and hard-coded URLs in inter-service communication. Due to limited understanding and project priorities, I could not initiate cross-team efforts. I will focus more on these areas moving forward.

Three
    Action:
        Highlight potential gaps or better solutions and propose them to management for adoption.
        Guide team members and delegate work, taking accountability to achieve final goals.

Four
    Action:
        Organize tech talks or similar discussions once a month, including members from different teams, to present solutions that our competitors or leading tech companies use and that can be beneficial for our organization.
        Create a mentorship program within the team to guide less experienced engineers, providing regular check-ins and feedback sessions.
    Action:
        Be more assertive and use official channels to push back on projects if they are beyond scope, ensuring clear communication of impact on timelines and quality.
        Implement a regular review process to assess current projects and identify any that need rescoping or re-prioritization.
    Action:
        Develop metrics and dashboards to track progress and impact, sharing these with the team and management regularly.
        Provide weekly updates on project status, highlighting achievements, blockers, and next steps to ensure transparency and accountability.


Thank you for outlining your expectations and observations. I appreciate your feedback and am committed to exceeding your expectations. Here’s my action plan to address the areas you highlighted:

Scope & Ownership:
    Develop a Generic Monitoring Framework: Complete RFC/ADR by Q3 for monitoring migration activities, starting with a-b migration.
    Increased Involvement in Release Processes: Gain access to work as a release manager and join the duty team within two weeks.
Multiplier Effect:
    Identify Gaps and Present Solutions: Create and present RFC/ADR documents quarterly in architecture meetings.
    Guide and Mentor Engineers: Finalize the backstage RFC by June and develop a mentorship program.
Thought Leadership:
    Document and Share Insights: Document questions and concerns in shared documents and present them in team meetings.
    Broaden Audience for Presentations: Include cross-team members in presentations for wider visibility and feedback.
Impact:
    Escalate Delays Promptly: Escalate delays in cross-team projects to higher management.
    Active Participation and Feedback: Engage actively in technical conversations, providing feedback based on my understanding of the product.
Initiative and Proactivity:
        Identify and Address Technical Gaps: Present quarterly RFC/ADR documents on identified gaps.
        Focus on Reliability and Autonomy: Prioritize initiatives that enhance reliability and engineering autonomy.
Technical Proficiency::
    Highlight and Propose Solutions: Propose better solutions to management and guide team members in implementing them.
    Coordinate and Delegate Effectively: Delegate tasks efficiently and ensure accountability for achieving final goals.
Collaboration and Communication::
    Inspire and Mentor: Organize monthly tech talks and create a mentorship program.
    Challenge Appropriately: Use official channels to push back on projects beyond scope and re-prioritize tasks as needed.
    Share Progress Transparently: Develop metrics and dashboards, providing weekly updates on project status.

I believe these steps will help me exceed your expectations and contribute more effectively to our team’s success. Thank you for your guidance and support.
